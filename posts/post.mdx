### On-Premise GPO

*`GPO's works close with Regedit, whenever updates are made you need to apply them by command gpupdate /force. on each server`*

*   **Computer Configuration:** Applies to computers where the GPO is applied, regardless of which user logs into the computer.

    *   **Example:** Windows update, Firewall, Password policy, lock screen timeout

*   **User Configuration:** Applies to users where the GPO is applied, regardless of which computer the user logs into.

    *   **Example:** Wallpaper, Application availability, Start menu settings
